This session expects the rank to end up at 9.0 (.5 higher than the original 8.5) but the other thread has
just updated the same record to 8.0 by subtracting half a point. If the update did an absolute operation
on the score (setting it to a number like 5.0) rather than setting it to a relative value (-.5 or +.5) this
lost update may be more visible.
