The sample data that I've used in my database has come from a variety of sources.
For example, the example breweries are ones that I have knowledge of, but the data
about them has been sourced either from their own websites or wikipedia.org for the
larger ones that have parent companies. The example beers were pulled either from
their brewery's website, which often included the ABV, IBU, and type of beer. Otherwise,
I obtained quite a bit of data from untappd.com, which is a beer logging service, as
well as a sort of database in itself. It almost always has all the data necessary, apart
from a few beer's IBUs (which isn't relevan to all beer, hence why some entries have a
NULL value in the IBU column). Distributors and their data were sourced from Google Maps.
Ratings were sourced from Untappd.com and beeradvocate.com, which are both community
sourced beer rating services. beeradvocate also provides professional ratings. Ingredients
were sourced from my own knowledge of brewing (hence why the list isn't extensive) and
will be expanded in the future from a more official source. Beers as sold by certain
Distributors is all ficticious data (albiet possible). This may eventually be sourced
by community input, or from retailer/Distributors' websites. Beer Ingredients are pulled
from the brewery's website descriptions of the beer.

My database is currently in BCNF as it has the following attributes:
1 - Each attribute of every table is atomic and only contains one value of its
  domain.
2 - No table has dependencies on more than one of its candidate keys.
3 - Each tables attributes are determined only by their candidate keys
  and not by any non-prime attributes.
3.5 - No tables have overlapping candidate keys.

I have chosen BCNF for my database since the concept of beers and breweries
can easily be broken up into multiple tables each with their own non-overlapping
attributes, and they can easily reference eachother without having too many functionl
dependencies.
