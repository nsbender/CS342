CS342 - Databases Final Project Proposal

The database that I plan to design is one relating to Michigan breweries and their beers. While it may sound trivial initially, I believe this could be relevant data for both beer enthusiasts as well as restaurants, grocery stores, and other berewers. Beer brewing, like other food and drink manufacturing, is a complicated process. Thus, this domain lends its self well to a database. Several tables would be required to keep track of information such as 

-Individual Breweries
-Their Beers
-Ingredients/recipies
-Regions in Michigan
-Distributors

and potentially more as the design is developed. There are other similar systems that currently exist, but none of
them go into detail about distribution or recipies (Not all breweries disclose this information).
