This nosql implementation of the beerdb includes all beers, breweries, and distributors. These are the primary 
tables in the database with the most useful information. From these tables, users can still learn all information 
about a beer, information about who made it, and information about the people that distribute beer. KVLite is a poor
way to implement this schema since the data in the BeerDB is highly relational, and much of the data relies on its
type in order to calculate averages, sums, etc. With a typeless KV store, this data all needs to be extracted from
strings before it is useful.

The queries implemented in this nosql system are as follow:

The first finds unique breweries and sorts them by the year (ascending) in which they were founded. This is useful
for when determining experience and potentailly beer quality from one brewery to the next. If a brewery has been
around for a long time, they likely have more brewing experience. Additionally, this data would be useful in 
tracking historical data, such as how many unique beers a brewery has created in its history.

The second categorizes beers by the brewery that produced them. This data is useful for seeing all beers for a 
particularl brewery. If a consumer/critic is trying to determine what else to try by this brewery, they now
have a definitive list. If distributors are trying to see all of their options for what to stock for a particular
brewery, they now can.
