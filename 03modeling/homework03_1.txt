--- A ---

A flight is a particular journey that happens every week on certain
days and is always done by the same airline.
A flight leg is a nonstop journey
between to airports and is identified by a flight number and leg number. Since
the flight is a regularly repeating occurrence, the flight leg can have
exact arrival and departure times on that particular weekday.
A flight leg instance is a leg that occurs or has occurred on a particular date.
A leg, much like a flight, is repeatable.

The real difference between these objects is the distance travelled in each
(flight vs leg) and that the leg instances have a particular, non-repeating date
on which they occur.

--- B ---

Since these objects in question are weak entities, and they still need some
type of identification, they are given a 'partial key' - a way of linking it to
the parent entity.

--- C ---

Seats are a part of reservation on a leg_instance, and not on a leg or flight
because, reservations change from instance to instance. The entire collection
of seats changes between leg_instances, so we need to track that.
