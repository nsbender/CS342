13.1
	a.  Compare and contrast the store.put() command used here for KVLite and the 
	em.persist() command you used for the GlassFish entity manager in the previous lab.
	
		
		
	b. Compare and contrast the store.put() command with the standard Java hashtable’s
	myHashTable.put() command.
	
13.2
	a. Compare and contrast KVLite keys with relational database keys.
	
		
		
13.3
	a. So far, the implementation has only dealt with records in one relational table, 
	Movie. Explain how a key-value database might implement the one-to-many join 
	relationships commonly implemented in relational databases using foreign keys.
	
	
	
	b. KVLite requires that there be a key, but it is possible to have an “empty” value. 
	Such a value can be created using Value.createValue(new byte[0]). Where might one need
	such a construct?
