1. Read Pramod Sadalage’s NoSQL Databases: An Overview (circa 2012) and explain:

	a. the key motivations for considering non-relational database systems.
	
		Better clustering, open sourcing, schema-less

	b. aggregate data models.
	
		A collection of data that is interacted with as a unit, much like OO programming. Forms the basis
		for the ACID properties.

	c. polyglot persistence.
	
		Not relational, clustering and built to run on many systems

	d. the relevance of the CAP theorem.
	
		Allows DB admins to tune their databases to run well on their systems regardless of their hardware. 
		Allows for different numbers of nodes, write requests, and replication

	e. the types of NoSQL databases.
	
		Key-Value Stores, Document Based, Column Based, Graph Based

	f. when (and when not) to use NoSQL database systems.
	
		NoSQL solutions are best when THE 'schema' may need to be refactored down the road. NoSQL DBs can be
		modified without downtime. Additionally, they can often have better throughput since the storage and
		business logic are often more separated.
		
2. Use “Getting Started with the Key/Value API”, Chapters 3–5, from the Oracle NoSQL Database documentation
as a reference. Be sure to know how to:

	a. Compare and contrast Major and minor key components.

		Records are stored based on the hash of the Major key, so KV pairs need at least one major. Minor 
		Components store additional data attached to the record that have no effect on how the pair is
		stored
