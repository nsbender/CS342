a. What type of noSQL database system is Oracle’s NoSQL product, KVLite?

	KVLite is a key-value store.

b. The Internet Movie DataBase (imdb.com) is currently implemented in mySQL. 
If you were required to port it to a noSQL system, which of the noSQL system types would you 
suggest? Explain your answer.

	A graph database would be the most effective in this case. Connected data, such as movies, their actors,
	and other roles, are pretty relational pieces of data. Queries are not easily written in the other three
	types of noSQL systems.

c. Could you (efficiently) reuse the same key-value structure for exercise 13.1.d (above) and 
its “opposite”, i.e., get the movies in which a given actor is cast? Why or why not?

	Not in this case. Actors are not a part of the major key of a movie. In order for this to work, the list
	of actors in a movie would need to each be a subkey.

d. NoSQL databases are often referred to as schema-less or schema-free. Explain what this 
means using examples from your homework solution.

	There is technically no schema in this KV implementation, but we have sort of forced a structure on it
	using major and minor keys. Additionally, the KV store has no checking on data types or rules about what
	can be inserted where. An movie with completely incorrect, out of 'range', or incorrectly typed data 
	would still be happily inserted into any kv pair.
