Read Sections 10.1, 10.4.1 & 26.1.1â€“2:

Name the three basic approaches to database programming.

	Embedded database commands in a general-purpose language
	Using a library of database functions
	Designing a brand new language

Explain the concepts of:

impedance mismatch

	A databases data structures being incompatible with a programming languages structures

stored procedures

	Database definitions that enforce rules on what can be accessed and how

triggers

	A form of rule activated by updates to a table, resulting in performing an additional operation
	
	
Compare and contrast:

procedural vs non-procedural languages.

	Non-Procedural languages contain the data that is to be operated on, but not the operations for that data.
	Procedural languages rely on previous statements on control structures. (not available in SQL)

client-side vs server-side database programming.

	Embedded SQL statements in a program (can be precompiled) are defined as client-side database programming.
	Server-side programming relies on API calls that the program makes, and the server queries the database
	returns the data to the client.

Explain why one would want to do server-side programming using PL/SQL.

	Server-side programming prevents malfunctioning programs from potentially harming the database, and lets
	a single server take care of managing the DB.

For each of the following code segments, identify the type of the database object and explain what it does.

CREATE PROCEDURE limited_count (limit IN integer) AS
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1..limit LOOP
      dbms_output.put_line(i);
  END LOOP;
END;

 

BEGIN
  dbms_output.put_line('Hello, PL/SQL!');
END;
 

CREATE TRIGGER log_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF lastName ON Person
  FOR each row
BEGIN
  dbms_output.put_line('Hello, name change!');
END;
