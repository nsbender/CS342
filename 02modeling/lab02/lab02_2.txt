/* ---------PART A--------- */

It is possible to require all moves to have a score of more than 1000 votes
if they are to have a non-NULL score. That constraint would be defined as:

ADD CONSTRAINT ScoreVote;
CHECK (score IS NULL or votes > 1000);

This would be defined as either an ALTERation to the Movie table, or would
be added at the time of the creation of the table.

/* ---------PART B--------- */

If you plan to modify the constraints of your table during its lifetime, then
you don't want to set all rules/constraints for it in its definition. Otherwise
you would need to change its definition regularly.

This has huge implications for your database, especially if a mistake is made.
