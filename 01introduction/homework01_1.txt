If the name of the ‘CS’ (Computer Science) Department changes to
‘CSSE’ (Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department and
the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the
columns in the database that would need to be updated.

The following columns would need to be updated:
  Major in the STUDENT table,
  Course_number and Department in the COURSE table,
  Course_number in the SECTION table,
  Course_number and Prerequisite_number in the PREREQUISITE table.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and PREREQUISITE
tables so that only one column will need to be updated?

Yes, if you remove the course prefix from all Course_number columns
in the above tables. Without a prefix, the only column that actually
needs to change is Department in COURSE.
