c. Exploring the project structure — How do the external libraries (in the project pane)
relate to J2SE and J2EE?

	Each of the files in the JDK (the .jar libraries) are the actual implementation of
	J2SE and J2EE.
	
d. Developing source code — Set the HTML title and body content to whatever you’d like.
At what tier does this application run?

	This application is the web tier. This will be the applicastion that the user is 
	interacting with.
	
e. Running the application & Modifying the code and observing the changes — What server does
this step use to serve up your application? For a hint, look at what’s served up at the
URL: /. How does it compare with a typical web server?

	This page is being served locally from glassfish as opposed to a true, dedicated web
	server.
	
f. Exploring an artifact configuration — Skim through these sections, making sure that
you can find the application features they discuss. What is a WAR file?

	A WAR file is the whole web application in an archive format which is ready for 
	deployment on a server.
	
g. Deploying an artifact onto a running server — Here, we run the app on a GlassFish server
running on the local machine, called a “remote” server because it’s running outside of
Intellij IDEA. What’s the difference between “exploded” and non-exploded WAR files?

h. Looking at other features (tool windows and facets) — Skim these sections but don’t
implement them. Compare and contrast EAR and WAR artifacts.

	An EAR contains multiple War archives. This is so multiple services can be hosted on the same
	server.
