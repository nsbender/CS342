Advanced SQL (Section 7.1, continued) — Write sample queries that:

Implement an inner join (Section 7.1.6).

	SELECT Student.id, StudentTeam.studentID
	FROM Student
	INNER JOIN StudentTeam -- For the INTERSECTION of the two tables
	ON Student.id = StudentTeam.studentID;

Implement an outer join (Section 7.1.6).


	SELECT Student.id, StudentTeam.studentID
	FROM Student
	OUTER JOIN StudentTeam -- For the UNION of the two tables
	ON Student.id = StudentTeam.studentID;
	

Use an aggregate function (Section 7.1.7).

	SELECT COUNT(id)
	FROM Team
	WHERE sectionId = 1;

	-- To count the number of teams that exist in section 1

Use grouping (Section 7.1.8).

	SELECT *
	FROM Team
	GROUP BY sectionId;
